Aogami is a **Shin Megami Tensei V** save editor. Edit by Zmbkilla to read Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance saves

# Features
- Edit player's first name and last name.

# More stuff
This won't be a large and advanced save editor like the last one I made, [Scramble](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble).
I hope Aogami is useful to you. Please report to me any bugs you may find.
